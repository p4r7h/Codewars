## Keep Hydrated!
`Nathan loves cycling.
Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.`

## Opposites Attract

``
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
```
def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 ):
    if flower1 % 2 == 0 and flower2 % 2 == 1 :
        return True
    elif flower1 % 2 == 1 and flower2 % 2 == 0 :
        return True
    else :
        return False

##  Multiplication table for number
`Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
`
```
def multi_table(number):
    a = ''
    for i in range(1,11):
        a += "{} * {} = {}\n".format(i,number,i*number)
    return a[:-1]

## get character from ASCII Value
`Write a function which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.`
```
def get_char(c):
    return chr(c) 
```

## Twice as old
`Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).`

```
def twice_as_old(dad_years_old, son_years_old):
    return abs(dad_years_old - (son_years_old * 2))
    pass
```
